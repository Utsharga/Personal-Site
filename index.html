        The device was designed for a client with multiple sclerosis. The aim of the design was to reduce the motion required by the hand to open the door. The device was made in precision to the clientâ€™s door handle and was made with affordable materials: 3D PTEG plastic, polyester, stainless still. The device completely eliminated the need for the client to rotate their wrist and relieving the client from the pain associated with opening the door to their apartment. ">

        Prosthetic arms are often made of different components and during this project, I was assigned to a team of 3 to build a train gear for a model prosthetic hand. The task required key understanding of Autodesk Inventor, and Gear Train & Ratio. The objective of the project was to design the train gear, and have it pick up items using the index finger and thumb. The final product fit perfectly into the arm and was able to pick up objects while keeping within the required input and output speeds. This project highlighted my ability to work in teams, work within constraints, meet deadlines on time and solve problems with a head strong mentality.">
