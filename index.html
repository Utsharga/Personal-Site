        <span>Hey there! I am Utsharga Anthony Cyril Rozario, I know a long name. But I usually go by Anthony or Utsharga, whichever is easier to pronounce. I am in second year Software Engineering at McMaster University.
          For as long as I can remember, I have aspired to be a software engineer. Working to achieve are the words I live by. I am an International student, on the course to achieve my dreams.</span>

        The objective of the project was to design the train gear, and have the device pick up items using the index finger and thumb. During this project, I was assigned to a team consisting 3 engineering students. The task required key understanding of Autodesk Inventor, and Gear Train & Ratio. The final product fit perfectly into the arm and was able to pick up objects while keeping within the required input and output speeds. This project highlighted my ability to work in teams, work within constraints, meet deadlines on time and solve problems with a head strong mentality.">

        The device was designed for a client with multiple sclerosis. The aim of the design was to reduce the motion required by the hand to open the door. The device was made in precision to the client’s door handle and was made with affordable materials: 3D PTEG plastic, polyester, stainless still. The device completely eliminated the need for the client to rotate their wrist and relieving the client from the pain associated with opening the door to their apartment. ">

        This project started off with converting existing paintings and sketches of my own into digital illustrations. This slowly evolved into making commissions for different artists to make digital illustrations of their art. This project involved cooperating with different people and editing countless hours to hold up the value of outstanding pieces of art and photography. This projected elevated my skills in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and exposed me to concept of digital communication.">

        This project started while trying out for the McMaster EcoCar team. The challenge required a group of 3 to program a CAV control system. While doing research for the project, the automated systems peaked my interest and I’ve been working on it ever since.">
