          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Hey! I am Utsharga Anthony Cyril Rozario, a student currently enrolled at McMaster University and studying Software Engineering.

          <h2>“Feed your curiosity, and it’ll lead you to the life you dream.”</h2>
          <p>
            The dream of being a programmer sparked within me at the age of 3 when I became fascinated with animation. My curiosity on how characters moved behind the scenes of the animated cartoons I watched, bloomed my dream to work as an engineer. My fascination soon evolved into a passion. I started programming around grade 8, with Visual Basic being my core as I wanted to develop games in Unity. While learning to code, I fell in love with it and became determined to be a software developer. I’ve ever since been learning about algorithms and coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            But coding is not the only thing that intrigued me, the Discovery Channel introduced me to Space. Governed by Einstein on one side and Charles Babbage on the other, I got involved in Quantum Physics and eventually Quantum Computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love programming. I like the industry. I like the people I meet with the same passion and ambition as me. I like to talk nerdy and embrace the geekiness in everyone. I hope to make this world a better place for everyone and if someday we cross paths, let’s make it a better place together.
